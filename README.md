## Questions?
Will this mod work on Forge/NeoForge?
> Not right now but maybe in the future.

Can I use this on other servers/single player?
> By default, the mod will prevent you from doing so. While this safety feature can be disabled in the config, it is not recommended. <br>
> I'll consider other servers in the future but I make no promises.
